## Introduction

In certain scenarios, you might need to extract information such as `X-Ig-App-Id`, `ds_user_id`, and `sessionid` from the network tab of the Instagram web application for analysis or debugging purposes. This project provides step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this using developer tools.

## Prerequisites

Before following the instructions, ensure that you have the following:

- A web browser with developer tools (commonly accessible by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
- An active Instagram account.

## Instructions

1. Open the Instagram web application in your preferred web browser.

2. Launch the developer tools by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`.

3. Navigate to the "Network" tab within the developer tools.

4. Interact with the Instagram web application as needed to generate network activity.

5. Look for the requests in the "Network" tab and locate the values of interest, such as `X-Ig-App-Id`, `ds_user_id`, and `sessionid`.

6. Once found, you can inspect the headers or other relevant information to extract the required values.

7. Use the extracted values as needed for your specific use case.
